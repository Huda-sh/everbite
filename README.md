# EverBite Restaurant Menu Management System (Job Application Task)

This project demonstrates a restaurant menu management system built with Laravel 11, Vue 3 Composition API, and Inertia for SSR. It allows restaurants to create and manage categories, subcategories, menu items, and discounts.


## Development Process

### Design Wireframe
### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)
![ERD](docs/erd.png "ERD")
The ERD depicts the following tables and their relationships:
- **Users**: Represents registered restaurants.
- **Categories**: Stores super and subcategories for menu items.
- **Items**: Represents menu items associated with categories.
- **Discounts**: Supports various discount types using a one-to-one polymorphic relationship with other entities. 

This approach avoids unnecessary relationships while offering flexibility in managing different discount types.

### Implementation
- Laravel 11.x 
- Vue 3.x 
- Inertia 1.x 
- Code Splitting for efficient bundle sizes (See Bundle Analyzer Report)

### Deployment

- See deployed app here: [everbitedashboard.hudashakir.serv00.net🔗](everbitedashboard.hudashakir.serv00.net)

## Offline Support

Due to the use of SSR, implementing offline support is currently out of scope. However, alternative approaches like service workers could be explored in the future.

## Performance
implemented code splitting to achive small bundle size

## Learning Objectives
This project provided an excellent opportunity to learn and apply the following concepts:
- **Laravel Actions:** I explored the use of Laravel Actions to encapsulate complex business logic and improve code organization.
- **SSR with Inertia:** I implemented Server-Side Rendering (SSR) using Inertia.js, which allowed me to leverage the benefits of SEO and initial page load performance while maintaining a reactive user experience.
- **Web Performance Techniques:** I employed code splitting and analyzed bundle sizes using tools like the Bundle Analyzer to ensure optimal application performance.
By focusing on these areas, I aimed to demonstrate my ability to learn new technologies and apply them to create a well-structured and performant web application.
